# Deep Learning Approach replacing The FDM for Insitu Stress Analysis
Compared to the high cost of computation of FDM Deep learning approaches like CNN, ANN can instanly give stress analysis once trained on accurate data
This project implements a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict in-situ stresses, offering a computationally efficient alternative to the traditional Finite Difference Method (FDM). The model achieved over 85% accuracy and demonstrated a 92% correlation with FDM results, validated using a 10% test data split.  

Technologies used include NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data preprocessing, model engineering, and performance analysis. This project explores the potential of machine learning to enhance efficiency in geomechanical stress analysis.
